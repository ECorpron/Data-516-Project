# Data-516-Project

## Goal
The Goal of this project is to do some analyzation of Covid data. My project is to attempt and find how big of an impact masking and masking mandates had on the number of Covid related deaths in El Paso, Colorado.

## The Data
The data is pulled from three locations.
* Covid death data is from John Hopkins: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university

* Mask mandate data is from the CDC: https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/U-S-State-and-Territorial-Public-Mask-Mandates-Fro/62d6-pm5i
(Unspecified License)
* Mask mandate compliance data is from the New York Times: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use

## Code Instructions
To run the code and get the outputs found in the repository run the Project Part 1 notebook file. Currently all outputs are made within the notebook.

## Folders
### Figures
This folder contains figures I find interesting. Currently all figures are made within the Project Part 1 file.

### Write-ups
Contains reports written for the project

### data
contains the raw data used in the analysis. I currently don't save any intermediate data files.

## Research Implications
It is currently still very early on to make any hard statements, but the figures I have made so far seem to imply that masking mandates in El Paso had little to no effect on the rates of death in El Paso.
