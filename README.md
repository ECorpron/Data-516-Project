# Data-516-Project

## Goal
The Goal of this project is to do some analyzation of Covid data. My project is to attempt and find how big of an impact masking and masking mandates had on the number of Covid related deaths in El Paso, Colorado.

## The Data
The data is pulled from three locations.
* Covid death data is from Jogn Hopkins: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university
* Mask mandate data is from the CDC: https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/U-S-State-and-Territorial-Public-Mask-Mandates-Fro/62d6-pm5i
* Mask mandate compliance data is from the New York Times: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use
